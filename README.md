# Spam-classifier-using-NLP
This repository contains the implementation of a spam detection system designed to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using Python and machine learning. The project leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction, and Naive Bayes classification to effectively predict and evaluate message classifications.

### Overview
The system processes a dataset of SMS messages, applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean and prepare the data, and uses a machine learning model to classify messages. Performance metrics are used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

### Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess SMS data using regex operations, tokenization, and NLTK's text processing libraries.
Feature Extraction: Convert preprocessed text data into numerical format using the CountVectorizer to create a bag-of-words model.
Model Training: Train a Naive Bayes classifier using the numerical features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics.

### Technologies
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK: Natural language processing tasks such as stemming and stopwords removal.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
Matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations.
